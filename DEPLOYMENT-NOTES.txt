IMPORTANT: Frontend Build Instructions
========================================

Your frontend has been built and zipped (frontend-build.zip), BUT:

⚠️  You MUST rebuild the frontend AFTER you deploy to Render and get your Render URL!

The current build contains a placeholder API URL that needs to be replaced.

Steps:
1. Deploy backend to Render (get your Render URL, e.g., https://heads-in-freezers-api.onrender.com)
2. Rebuild the frontend with your actual Render URL:
   
   Windows:
   build-for-namecheap.bat https://your-actual-render-url.onrender.com
   
   Or manually:
   $env:VITE_API_URL="https://your-actual-render-url.onrender.com/api/generate-meme"; npm run build

3. Create a new zip from the dist folder
4. Upload to Namecheap

Your domain: www.241543903.xyz

The server.js has been updated with your domain for CORS settings.
Make sure to set FRONTEND_URL=https://www.241543903.xyz in Render environment variables.
